Package commontypes provides the few types I'm always creating for various projects. I've decided that rather than continuing to do them by hand every single time, I'm going to dump them up here and import them.

Have included (Unm|M)arshalText and (Unm|M)arshalJSON for all types for convenient loading from configuration files/json blobs.
